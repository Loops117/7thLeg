myspecies module â€” extracted views

Files:
- table.html / table.js
- cards.html / cards.js
- myspecies.css

Notes:
- "Download Example" and "Upload List" options were removed.
- JS was heuristically extracted from your userspecies.js focusing on these containers:
  - #inventory-table-container
  - #inventory-cards-container
If you'd like me to wire exact functions you use today, paste (or point me to) the render/init parts and I will align them exactly.
